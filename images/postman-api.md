# Understanding APIs and Using Postman

Today we began learning about APIs; what they are, how to query them, how to troublshoot them and how to break them. It's been since bootcamp when I last used Postman or wrote code to query an API, but today was a good refresher.

There are many ways to interact with an API, we do it daily and probably don't realize we're using them. Today we used Postman to access free APIs from the Rapid API site. Here are some of our activities:

We first inspected webpages and talked about the various files that make up a webpage, and status codes. Browsing through Chrome dev tools, we looked at the networking, disabling JavaScript and picking apart the request and response headers. Here are some links we used:

- [Rapid API](https://rapidapi.com/Travelpayouts/api/flight-data/details)
- [Postman Contact List API](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/401288/SWLceUSf?version=latest)
- [Faviocopes.com](https://flaviocopes.com/http-request-headers/)
- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_urlencode.ASP)
- [Mozilla Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status)

During the contact list exercise, we used the most commong HTTP methods to interact with the API; POST, GET, PUT, DELETE. Very similar to the CRUD operations that are used when accessing databases (CREATE, READ, UPDATE,DELETE).

Next, we moved on to a fligh data api to play around with Postman and figuring out how to retrive specific data. We edited the header to get various information back as well as used a token to retrive the data.
